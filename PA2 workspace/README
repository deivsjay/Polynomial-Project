ACKNOWLEDGE ANY OUTSIDE SOURCES

List here any code you submitted for this assignment that was written
with significant help of a course staff member, or code used from the
textbook.  Be specific about what methods or algorithms are involved,
and what sections of the textbook are involved (if applicable): [you do
not need to list any of the code that we wrote for the assignment,

KNOWN BUGS or LIMITATIONS:

PolynomialCalculator:

1. Cannot input incorrect amount of numbers after calculator command (e.g. cannot input create 0 1)

2. Cannot input number before calculator command (e.g. 0 create)

3. If letters are inputed when numbers are supposed to be inputed, the correct calculation won't execute 
e.g.
cmd> create 0
Enter a space-separated sequence of coeff-power pairs terminated by <nl>
creaet
cmd> print 0
0.0

4. When a polynomial is evaluated, if the result of the evaluation is a long decimal number, it is not rounded.
