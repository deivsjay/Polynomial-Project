Polynomial.java notes:
You may not change the interface for this class, with the following exception: you may add a public Polynomial toString method that you may want to use for debugging purposes. It would probably mostly call the toString method(s) of its constituent part(s). That way you can see if you are building your Polynomial object correctly, even before you implement toFormattedString.

PolynomialTester.java notes:
not required to submit this .java file
if PolynomialCalculator.java is compiled alongside this, it'll be hard to find bugs

PolynomialCalculator.java notes:
output should be exactly the same as prompt
help command and error messages won't be the same for each solution
errors it must check for:
- invalid command
- illegal polynomial index (for the array of polynomials)
- polynomial data for create command
	- missing the last exponent --> ignore last value	(label with "WARNING:")
	- negative exponents turn positive with abs value	(label with "WARNING:")
all errors must have error messages displayed starting with "ERROR:"

README:
- known bugs
- document test cases that fail that are being submitted
- give grader special notes for compiling if needed
